## PlaygroundVR

Since before video game was a thing, we already played games but using our imagination instead of the “video” part. When we play pretend or board games like RPGs, what we actually wish we were doing is to just be there. Sure these games are and will always be fun, but when you imagine yourself killing a Dragon, wouldn’t it be way more interesting if you were there killing the real thing instead of rolling a dice?

Video Games debuted two-dimensional, and it took long until it started rendering 3D. The jump to 3D wasn’t easy though. There were a lot of hardware limitations, both in the development and design areas, and on top of that, even game designer had a hard time figuring out how games would work in this new dimension. Of course that was way back then. Get back to Now a days and 3D is what we think of when we picture ourself playing a game. 2D didn’t get out of existence, but 3D is a pretty big deal now.

We are exactly at that same spot when it comes to VR. We all know it’s the future yet we can’t really figure out how. There are hardware limitations, game designers still don’t know what to do with it and also a lack of proper games to make it viable for investments. That’s when it get’s to that weird situation where there aren’t enough players for games to be produced, but also not enough games to get people excited.

That’s when we have to act. When I look back, I really wish I was there when 3D was starting out. Everything was so much more challenging yet more exciting. There are great stories of game developers having to deal with limitations to make the game work. Now a days on the other hand, everything is done so seamlessly that it ends up loosing the magic of discovery developers had back in the days. But that’s when I realized I didn’t have to look back. We are going through the same right now, and It’s up to us, the indie devs to make something out of it and push the industry forward. How exciting.

First things first. It seems Valve is doing some crazy researches about connecting the game directly to our brains or something. We have no idea when that will come out, if it ever will, so we better work with what we have now. VR has lots of problems, so I tried to tackle one of them. I couldn’t do anything about the price, but I noticed the space is essencial for a VR game to work. Imagine if we were in your house, but in a virtual reality. First, to navigate it, I would need a place as big as your house itself. Now imagine we are connecting my house to it. We would need an even bigger place now. I think you got what the problem is here. Video games can be huge, and there is no space for that in your room without you bumping into walls. Of course you could play using a controller, and only tilting your head to look for things. The problem is, This method takes aways the immersion, and can even get you motion sick. Your body just doesn’t understand how you can be moving while staying still.

Now I introduce you to the concept of Non-Euclidian geometry. It’s quite complex. It envolves some parallel lines that actually meet each other at some point. Crazy stuff right? But don’t you worry, that’s the math concept, and its actually pretty interesting. You should definitely check it out. But here, what we need is the video game concept of it, which is really just a space that can’t be reproduced in reality but can in virtual reality. Can you go down stairs but actually up? No, but in a game you can. Now, just how will that help us. It’s quite simple. We just have to create a space, let’s say, the size of your room where we can fit an infinite amount of space in it. Back to the house exemple, you would be in your room, but going around in circles would take you to different rooms in your house, all within the limited space you are walking in the real world. Still hard to picture it, right? Take a look at this.

By using this concept we can create an entire VR game, which is more accessible, requiring only a very small space, when in the virtual world the player is traveling through many places.
